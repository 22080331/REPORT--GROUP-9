Debit Card:
Observation: Debit Card is moderately popular nowadays but less use than UPI or COD.
Possible Reasons: Some customers do not feel very inclined to use any debit cards because of security issues, hence would rather do UPI or pay cash on delivery.
 UPI is expected to have lower average spending amounts as compared to than Debit Cards even in Categories like Furniture. When UPI limits set are too low, but the cost of the intended purchase can be paid in one sitting then it will be preferred.

  -Guards with Outliers: there are a few Guards that are notably heavy for their height. This hints at outliers, however, they might have unique physiques or playing styles. Although 
   some might think this is unusual, it can actually be an advantage. Because of their weight, they can hold their ground better during games, but it's not just about size.
